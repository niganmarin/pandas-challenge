    "In reviewing the data it looks like school size and spending per student are big factors for passing scores in reading and math. 15 schools brought back an average score of 65% which would imply all the schools should be in that range. I've found that the large size schools and schools that spend more than $630 per student scores start significantly falling compared to other schools. With that data I can assume that some schools poor performance brought down the good schools performances. Charter schools did better in every category vs district schools. Medium and small size schools pass both math and reading at a much higher percentage that large size schools. \n",
